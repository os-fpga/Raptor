	#The following demo line has these properties:

	#	It expires on 1-jan-2030
	#	It's uncounted, and therefore requires no server (no 
	#	lmgrd needed)
	#	It will run on any node.

FEATURE f1 demo 1.000 01-jan-2030 uncounted HOSTID=DEMO SIGN=0


        #	The next demo line is just like the first, but will not 
        #	expire.  This is ONLY useful if your application gets the 
        #	CONFIG * struct for this FEATURE line, and determines that 
        #	it's a DEMO type HOSTID, and uses this fact to limit the 
        #	behavior of the application to "demonstration" functions 
        #	only.
