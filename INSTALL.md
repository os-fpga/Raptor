# Raptor
----
Raptor is the Rapid Silicon complete FPGA EDA design environment.  The primary user experience combines a Tcl-based scripting environment with a Qt-based GUI cockpit.  The back-end toolchain consists of a suite of open source tools with proprietary components for specific features.

## DOWNLOAD AND INSTALLATION

### DOWNLOADING RAPTOR
Raptor is provided via digital download either from the Rapid Silicon FTP server or from a private lounge web site.  Please reach out to your Rapid Silicon point-of-contact to determine which is appropriate for your use.

Raptor is provided as a TAR archive (.tar.gz) file.

### VERIFYING THE DOWNLOAD
Once the download is complete, please verify the integrity of the download by comparing the checksum of the downloaded file against the provided checksum file.

`$ md5sum -c <path_to_checsum_file>.md5 <path_to_downloaded_tar_file>`

### INSTALLING RAPTOR
#### Installing with default options

With default options, you are allowing the Raptor executable to install all the OS pre requisite and install Raptor in default location i.e. /opt
Providing any other options except `-v or --verbose` will have no effect in this case.
Go to the directory where you have extracted the Raptor executable after downloading and execute it with SUDO/admin account like below

```
./Raptor_x.x.run
```

Replace `Raptor_x.x.run` with the version of Raptor executable file you have received.

#### Installing with personal choices

Following command line options available:

* -b | --batch-mode   -> running in interactive mode. Mandatory if you want to use -r or -i option
* -r | --raptor-home  -> you are giving the absolute path of directory where Raptor will be installed
* -i | --install-dep  -> Turn on the OS dependecies installation
* -v | --verbose      -> increase the installer verbosity.

Go to the directory where you have extracted the Raptor exe after downloading and execute it with any or with all above mentioned options like below

```
./Raptor_x.x.run -- -i -v -r <absolute path where Raptor will be installed>
``` 

Replace `Raptor_x.x.run` with the version of Raptor exe file you have received.

## LICENSING

### OBTAINING A LICENSE
Some components of Raptor are currently based on 3rd-party proprietary tooling.  These components are license-controlled and require a FlexLM-based license in order to operate.

To obtain a FlexLM license for the Raptor installion, please reach out to your Rapid Silicon point-of-contact for additional guidance.  Licenses are available in two types:
* Node-Locked: A node-locked license restricts the license-controlled software to operating on a single computing device such as an individual workstation or server
* Floating: A floating license is hosted on a network-accessible server using FlexLM license hosting software.  Individual installations of Raptor can temporarily check-out a license during operation and return it to the pool when finished.  This technique allows sharing among multiple users.

Please let your Rapid Silicon point-of-contact know which type of license you would like to receive.

### INSTALLING AND CONFIGURING A LICENSE
On the client workstation, set the `LM_LICENSE_FILE` environment variable.  For node-locked workstations, specify the full path to the license file.  For floating licenses, a FlexLM server daemon is required.  This daemon is provided by Rapid Silicon and is used to host the floating license on a specific port.

Example license lookup variables:
* Node-Locked: `LM_LICENSE_FILE = path/on/disk/LICENSE.DAT`
* Floating: `LM_LICENSE_FILE = <por>@<hostname>`

### CHECKING LICENSE STATUS
The FlexLM licensing environment provides a suite of tools that can parse a given system (or server in the case of floating licenses) and report back the available licenses and the number of seats occupied.  The primary tool is `lmutil`.  This tool provides a suite of sub-commands such as `lmutil lmstat` that can be used to investigate the status of the floating license server.
